        <p>Stephen Hawking (January 8, 1942 to March 14, 2018) was a British scientist, professor and author <br>
            who performed groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology, and whose books helped to make <br>
            science accessible to everyone. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the University of Cambridge, <br>
            he was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). <br>

                <p style="margin: 0.3rem;">A Brief History of Time also wasn't as easy to understand as some <br> had hoped. So in 2001, Hawking followed up his book with the <br> Universe in a Nutshell, which offered a more illustrated guide to <br> cosmology's big theories.

In this book,<br> Hawking takes us  through the mysteries of black holes and their role in <br> the universe. He also explores the physics behind these fascinating <br> objects, explaining the fascinating concepts of event horizons, singularities, <br> and wormholes.
